During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. Some malicious content was identified within the website code. After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:



### a. On App Server 3 at location /var/www/html/ecommerce find out all files (not directories) having .js extension.


### b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /ecommerce on same server.


### c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/ecommerce directory content.

--------
Certainly! To achieve this task, you can use the following commands on App Server 3:

a. To find all files with a .js extension:

```bash
find /var/www/html/ecommerce -type f -name "*.js"
```

b. To copy those files along with their parent directory structure to the /ecommerce directory:

```bash
find /var/www/html/ecommerce -type f -name "*.js" -exec cp --parents {} /ecommerce \;
```

This command will find all files with a .js extension under /var/www/html/ecommerce and copy them to the /ecommerce directory while maintaining their parent directory structure.

c. Confirm that only the required files were copied:

```bash
ls -R /ecommerce
```

This command will list the contents of the /ecommerce directory, and you should see only the .js files along with their respective directory structure.
