xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:



a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 2.


b. Apache should serve on port 3003.


c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/beta and /home/thor/cluster on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that beta should work on the link http://localhost:3003/beta/ and cluster should work on link http://localhost:3003/cluster/ on the mentioned app server.


d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:3003/beta/ and curl http://localhost:3003/cluster/

#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.
# In particular, see 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html>
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.
#
# See the httpd.conf(5) man page for more information on this configuration,
# and httpd.service(8) on using and configuring the httpd service.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so 'log/access_log'
# with ServerRoot set to '/www' will be interpreted by the
# server as '/www/log/access_log', where as '/log/access_log' will be
# interpreted as '/log/access_log'.

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the
# Mutex directive, if file-based mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the
# same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at
# least PidFile.
#
ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 3003

#
# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Statically compiled modules (those listed by `httpd -l') do not need
# to be loaded here.
#
# Example:
# LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so
#
Include conf.modules.d/*.conf

#
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.  
#
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
# It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for
# running httpd, as with most system services.
#
User apache
Group apache

# 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
#
ServerAdmin root@localhost

#
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
#
#ServerName www.example.com:80

#
# Deny access to the entirety of your server's filesystem. You must
# explicitly permit access to web content directories in other 
# <Directory> blocks below.
#
<Directory />
    AllowOverride none
    Require all denied
</Directory>

#
# Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow
# particular features to be enabled - so if something's not working as
# you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it
# below.
#

#
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.

    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"

    # Example:
    # Alias /webpath /full/filesystem/path
    #
    # If you include a trailing / on /webpath then the server will

Certainly! To accomplish the tasks you've outlined, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Install httpd and dependencies on app server 2

Connect to app server 2 and install the httpd package along with its dependencies:

```bash
ssh thor@app_server_2
sudo yum install httpd
```

### Step 2: Configure Apache to serve on port 3003

Edit the Apache configuration file to set it to listen on port 3003:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

Find the line that starts with `Listen` and change the port to 3003:

```conf
Listen 3003
```

Save the changes and exit.

### Step 3: Set up the websites

Copy the website backups from the jump host to the app server:

```bash
scp thor@jump_host:/home/thor/beta /var/www/html/
scp thor@jump_host:/home/thor/cluster /var/www/html/
```

### Step 4: Configure Apache to serve the websites on specific links

Edit the Apache configuration file to create virtual hosts:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

Add the following VirtualHost sections at the end of the file:

```conf
<VirtualHost *:3003>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    <Location "/beta">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Location>
    <Location "/cluster">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
