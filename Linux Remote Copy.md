### One of the Nautilus developers has copied confidential data on the jump host in Stratos DC. That data must be copied to one of the app servers. Because developers do not have access to app servers, they asked the system admins team to accomplish the task for them.



Copy `/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg` file from jump server to `App Server 1` at location `/home/webapp`.



    
thor@jump_host ~$ ```scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg tony@stapp01:/home/webapp/```

nautilus.txt.gpg                                                                    100%  105   144.1KB/s   00:00    


```ruby
The command scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg tony@stapp01:/home/webapp/ is using the scp (Secure Copy) command to copy a file from one location to another.
Let me break down the command for you:

scp: This is the command itself, which stands for "Secure Copy."

/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg: This is the source file that you want to copy. It specifies the path to the file you want to transfer.
In this case, it's /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg, which is assumed to be on the local system where you are running the scp command.

tony@stapp01: This part specifies the destination server and the user to log in as. Here's what it means:

tony: This is the username you will use to log in to the destination server.
stapp01: This is the hostname or IP address of the destination server.
:/home/webapp/: This is the destination path on the remote server (stapp01). It specifies where you want to copy the file to. In this case, it's /home/webapp/, which means you want to copy the file to the /home/webapp/ directory on the remote server.

So, in summary, the scp command is used to securely copy the nautilus.txt.gpg file from your local system (where you are running the command) to the remote server named stapp01,
 placing it in the /home/webapp/ directory on that server. You'll need to provide the password or appropriate authentication method for the user 'tony' on the remote server for the file transfer to occur.
```
