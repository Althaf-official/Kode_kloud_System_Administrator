The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need to create a bash script named ecommerce_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2).



a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip of /var/www/html/ecommerce directory.


b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis. Therefore, we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.


c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.


d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while copying the archive file. Additionally, the respective server user (for example, tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.

```
It looks like there's a series of commands and interactions between two hosts, `stapp02` and `stbkp01`, as well as a jump host (`jump_host`). Let's break down the actions that took place:

1. **Attempted SSH Connection to `stapp02`:**
   - User attempted to SSH into `stapp02` using `ssh steve@stapp02`.
   - Provided password multiple times, but permission was denied.
   - Then tried connecting using the full domain name `stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.
   - Successfully logged in after confirming the host's authenticity.

2. **Execution on `stapp02`:**
   - Checked the contents of the home directory (`ls`).
   - Switched to the root user with `sudo su -`.
   - Checked the root user's home directory (`ls`).
   - Checked the content of a script (`cat /scripts/news_backup.sh`).
   - Attempted to copy the SSH key to another machine (`ssh-copy-id clint@stbkp01`), but encountered an error related to the key file.

3. **Troubleshooting and Copying SSH Key:**
   - Moved to the `/scripts/` directory (`cd /scripts/`).
   - Tried copying the SSH key again, encountered an error related to the key file.
   - Checked the directory content (`ls`).
   - Successfully copied the SSH key to `stbkp01` using `ssh-copy-id clint@stbkp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.

4. **Backup Script Execution:**
   - Made the script executable (`chmod +x news_backup.sh`).
   - Successfully executed the backup script (`sh news_backup.sh`), which created a zip file containing news-related content.

5. **SSH Connection to `stbkp01`:**
   - Attempted to SSH into `stbkp01` from `stapp02`.
   - Confirmed host authenticity and successfully logged in.

6. **Verification on `stbkp01`:**
   - Checked the content of the `/backup/` directory on `stbkp01` (`ls`).
   - Checked the content of the zip file (`cat xfusioncorp_news.zip`).

Overall, it appears that the user, named Steve, successfully executed a backup script on `stapp02` and transferred the backup file to `stbkp01`. The SSH key was added to the authorized keys on `stbkp01`, allowing passwordless SSH access from `stapp02`.
