The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:



PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.


a. Create a database user kodekloud_aim and set its password to LQfKeWWxWD.


b. Create a database kodekloud_db4 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_aim on this database.


Note: Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

postgres=# 
postgres=# 
postgres=# CREATE USER kodekloud_sam WITH PASSWORD 'LQfKeWWxWD';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE kodekloud_db4;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kodekloud_db4 TO kodekloud_sam;
GRANT
postgres=# 
```

Certainly! To achieve the tasks you mentioned on CentOS, you can use the following steps. You'll need to access the PostgreSQL server's command line tool, `psql`, for these tasks.

1. **Login to PostgreSQL Server:**
   Open a terminal on the server where PostgreSQL is installed, and log in as the PostgreSQL superuser (usually `postgres`).

    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```

2. **Create User and Set Password:**
   Inside the `psql` command prompt, create the database user `kodekloud_sam` and set its password to `LQfKeWWxWD`.

    ```sql
    CREATE USER kodekloud_sam WITH PASSWORD 'LQfKeWWxWD';
    ```

3. **Create Database and Grant Permissions:**
   Still within the `psql` command prompt, create the database `kodekloud_db4` and grant full permissions to the user `kodekloud_sam`.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE kodekloud_db4;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kodekloud_db4 TO kodekloud_sam;
    ```

4. **Exit `psql`:**
   Exit the `psql` command prompt.

    ```sql
    \q
    ```

Now, you have created a PostgreSQL user (`kodekloud_sam`) and set its password, and also created a database (`kodekloud_db4`) with full permissions granted to the user. You can use these credentials and database in your application.

Make sure to configure your application with the appropriate database connection details (host, port, username, password, and database name) based on the setup you've just created.

Certainly! Let's break down the provided sequence of commands step by step:

1. **SSH into stdb01 as peter:**

    ```bash
    thor@jump_host ~$ ssh peter@stdb01
    ```

    - You connect to the server `stdb01` using SSH with the username `peter`.

2. **Confirm Host Authenticity:**

    ```
    The authenticity of host 'stdb01 (172.16.239.10)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:RxCgwmDqbqkfwklAfkETwlAkAysFxShKQ43oCbOQIgA.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'stdb01,172.16.239.10' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    ```

    - The SSH client asks for confirmation to connect to the server and adds the server's key to the list of known hosts.

3. **Enter peter's Password:**

    ```
    peter@stdb01's password:
    ```

    - You enter the password for the user `peter` on the server `stdb01`.

4. **Switch to Root User:**

    ```
    [peter@stdb01 ~]$
    [peter@stdb01 ~]$
    [peter@stdb01 ~]$
    [peter@stdb01 ~]$ sudo su -
    ```

    - You switch to the root user using `sudo su -` and enter the root password when prompted.

5. **Enter Root Password:**

    ```
    [sudo] password for peter:
    ```

    - You enter the password for the user `peter` again to execute the `sudo` command.

6. **Access PostgreSQL as Root (Initially Fails):**

    ```
    [root@stdb01 ~]# psql
    Password: 
    psql: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "root"
    ```

    - You try to access PostgreSQL as the root user, but it fails because PostgreSQL doesn't use the root user by default.

7. **Access PostgreSQL as Root (Second Attempt):**

    ```
    [root@stdb01 ~]# psql
    Password: 
    psql: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "root"
    ```

    - The second attempt still fails.

8. **Access PostgreSQL as PostgreSQL User:**

    ```
    [root@stdb01 ~]# sudo -u postgres psql
    could not change directory to "/root": Permission denied
    psql (10.23)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=#
    postgres=#
    postgres=# CREATE USER kodekloud_sam WITH PASSWORD 'LQfKeWWxWD';
    CREATE ROLE
    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE kodekloud_db4;
    CREATE DATABASE
    postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kodekloud_db4 TO kodekloud_sam;
    GRANT
    postgres=#
    ```

    - You successfully access PostgreSQL as the `postgres` user using `sudo -u postgres psql`.
    - Then, you create a new PostgreSQL user (`kodekloud_sam`), a new database (`kodekloud_db4`), and grant all privileges on the new database to the new user.
