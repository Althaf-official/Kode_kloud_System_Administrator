As per new application requirements shared by the Nautilus project development team, serveral new packages need to be installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. Most of them are completed except for epel-release.



Therefore, install the epel-release package on all app-servers.

Certainly! To install the `epel-release` package on all app servers in the Stratos Datacenter, you can use the following steps. Assuming you are using a package manager like `yum` (common on Red Hat and CentOS systems):

```bash
# Install epel-release package
sudo yum install epel-release

# Update the package manager
sudo yum update
```

You can run these commands on each app server in your Stratos Datacenter. This will install the EPEL repository and update the package manager to include the packages from EPEL.

If you encounter any issues or have a different package manager, please let me know, and I can provide more specific instructions.
