Setting up password-less authentication from a jump host to multiple app servers involves using SSH key pairs. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair on the Jump Host (Thor's Machine):**
   Open a terminal on Thor's machine and generate an SSH key pair using the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
   ```

   Follow the prompts to save the key pair to the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) or a custom location.

2. **Copy the Public Key to App Servers:**
   Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy Thor's public key to each app server. Replace `<app_server>` with the actual IP address or hostname of each app server:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id <sudo_user>@<app_server>
   ```

   You'll be prompted for the sudo user's password on each app server.

   If `ssh-copy-id` is not available, manually copy the contents of Thor's public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on each app server for the respective sudo user.

3. **Verify Password-less Authentication:**
   Try to SSH into each app server from Thor's machine without entering a password:

   ```bash
   ssh <sudo_user>@<app_server>
   ```

   Ensure that you can connect without being prompted for a password.

4. **Update SSH Configuration (Optional):**
   If you want to further secure your SSH configuration, you can edit the SSH configuration file on Thor's machine (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to disallow password authentication and only allow key-based authentication:

   ```bash
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

   After making changes, restart the SSH service:

   ```bash
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```

   Ensure you have tested your key-based authentication before making these changes to avoid getting locked out.

Now, Thor should be able to SSH into each app server without entering a password. Make sure to replace `<sudo_user>` and `<app_server>` with the actual sudo username and app server details. Additionally, be cautious when making changes to SSH configuration files to avoid unintended consequences.
