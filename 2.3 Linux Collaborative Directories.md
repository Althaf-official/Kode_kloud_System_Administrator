The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the sysops group of the team.



Setup a collaborative directory /sysops/data on app server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.


The directory should be group owned by the group sysops and the group should own the files inside the directory. The directory should be read/write/execute to the user and group owners, and others should not have any access.

Certainly! Let me explain each command:

1. **`chown :sysops /sysops/data`**

   This command is used to change the ownership of the `/sysops/data` directory to the group `sysops`. Here's a breakdown:

   - `chown`: Stands for "change owner." It is used to change the user and/or group ownership of files or directories.
   - `:sysops`: Specifies the group to which ownership is being changed. The colon (`:`) indicates that only the group is being changed.
   - `/sysops/data`: The path to the directory whose ownership is being changed.

   After running this command, the group ownership of `/sysops/data` is set to `sysops`.

2. **`chmod 770 /sysops/data`**

   This command is used to change the permissions of the `/sysops/data` directory. Here's what each digit represents:

   - The first digit (7): Represents the permissions for the owner (user) of the file/directory. 7 is a combination of read (4), write (2), and execute (1).
   - The second digit (7): Represents the permissions for the group owner. Again, 7 is a combination of read (4), write (2), and execute (1).
   - The third digit (0): Represents the permissions for others (users not in the owner or group). 0 means no permissions.

   So, with `chmod 770 /sysops/data`, the user and group owners have full read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions, while others have no permissions.

3. **`chmod g+s /sysops/data`**

   This command sets the setgid bit on the `/sysops/data` directory. The setgid bit ensures that files created in this directory inherit the group ownership of the parent directory. Here's a breakdown:

   - `chmod`: Stands for "change mode." It is used to change the file or directory permissions.
   - `g+s`: Sets the setgid bit for the group.
   - `/sysops/data`: The directory for which the setgid bit is being set.

   Setting the setgid bit is useful when you want all files created in `/sysops/data` to have the same group ownership as `/sysops/data`. This is particularly useful in collaborative environments where multiple users need access to the same group-owned directory.

In summary, these commands are setting up the `/sysops/data` directory to be owned by the `sysops` group, with read, write, and execute permissions for the user and group owners, and no permissions for others. The setgid bit ensures that new files created in the directory inherit the group ownership.


To achieve the specified setup, you can follow these steps. Assuming you have the necessary permissions, you can perform these actions on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter.

1. **Create the sysops group:**
   
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd sysops
   ```

2. **Create the /sysops/data directory:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /sysops/data
   ```

3. **Set the group ownership to sysops:**

   ```bash
   sudo chown :sysops /sysops/data
   ```

4. **Set the directory permissions:**

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 770 /sysops/data
   ```

   This will give read/write/execute permissions to the user and group owners, and no permissions to others.

5. **Make sure all future files created in this directory have sysops group ownership:**

   ```bash
   sudo chmod g+s /sysops/data
   ```

   This sets the setgid bit, which makes sure that new files created in the directory inherit the group ownership of the parent directory.

Now, the `/sysops/data` directory is set up with the specified permissions and group ownership. Any user who needs access to this data should be added to the `sysops` group. You can add users to the group using the `usermod` command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sysops username
```

Replace `username` with the actual username of the user who needs access.

Please note that the specific commands may vary depending on the Linux distribution you are using. The above commands are suitable for distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS. Adjust them accordingly if you are using a different distribution.
