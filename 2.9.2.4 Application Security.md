We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup server itself, and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 5004 and 8099, respectively. We have iptables firewall installed on this server. Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:



We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.

To achieve the desired firewall configuration, you can use the `iptables` command. Here's how you can open all incoming connections to Nginx's port (8099) and block all incoming connections to Apache's port (5004), and make the rules permanent:

```bash
# Open incoming connections to Nginx's port (8099)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8099 -j ACCEPT

# Block incoming connections to Apache's port (5004)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5004 -j DROP

# Save the rules to make them permanent
sudo service iptables save
```

Note: The actual commands might vary slightly depending on the Linux distribution you are using. In some distributions, you might use `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` to save and apply the rules.

After applying these rules, incoming connections to Nginx's port (8099) should be allowed, and connections to Apache's port (5004) should be blocked. Make sure to test the configuration to ensure that it meets your requirements and doesn't affect other services. Additionally, it's a good practice to have a backup of your firewall configuration before making changes.

Certainly! Let's break down each line of the provided commands:

1. **Open incoming connections to Nginx's port (8099):**
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8099 -j ACCEPT
   ```

   - `sudo`: This command is used to run the subsequent command with administrative privileges.
   - `iptables`: This is the command-line utility for configuring the Linux kernel firewall.
   - `-A INPUT`: This specifies that the rule should be appended to the INPUT chain, which is responsible for handling incoming packets.
   - `-p tcp`: This specifies the protocol (TCP in this case).
   - `--dport 8099`: This specifies the destination port (8099 for Nginx).
   - `-j ACCEPT`: This indicates that if a packet matches the specified conditions, it should be accepted.

   So, this line adds a rule to allow incoming TCP connections to port 8099.

2. **Block incoming connections to Apache's port (5004):**
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5004 -j DROP
   ```

   - Similar to the previous command, this line appends a rule to the INPUT chain.
   - It specifies that incoming TCP connections to port 5004 should be dropped (`-j DROP`).
   - This effectively blocks any incoming connections to Apache's port.

3. **Save the rules to make them permanent:**
   ```bash
   sudo service iptables save
   ```

   - After configuring the rules using the `iptables` command, you need to save them to make them permanent across reboots.
   - The specific method to save the rules may vary depending on your Linux distribution. In this case, it assumes that the `iptables` service provides a way to save the rules using the `save` option.

It's important to note that the exact commands and procedures can vary between different Linux distributions. Some distributions may use `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` commands for saving and applying rules. Additionally, some systems might use other tools like `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) or `firewalld` for managing firewall rules. Always verify the specific commands and procedures based on your system's configuration.
