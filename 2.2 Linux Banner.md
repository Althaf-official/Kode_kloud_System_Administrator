During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.



Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host

It looks like you successfully updated the Message of the Day (MOTD) on the `stapp01` server using the approved banner template. Here's a breakdown of the commands you executed:

1. **Attempt to Move the Banner:**
   ```bash
   ssh -t tony@stapp01 'sudo mv /tmp/nautilus_banner  /etc/motd'
   ```
   In this command, you attempted to move the banner from `/tmp/nautilus_banner` to `/etc/motd` on the remote server. However, the initial attempt failed because the file wasn't found in the `/tmp` directory.

2. **Copy Banner to Remote Server:**
   ```bash
   scp -r /home/thor/nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:/tmp
   ```
   You copied the `nautilus_banner` file from your local home directory to the `/tmp` directory on the remote server (`stapp01`). This step was successful.

3. **Retry Move Operation:**
   ```bash
   ssh -t tony@stapp01 'sudo mv /tmp/nautilus_banner /etc/motd'
   ```
   After copying the banner to the remote server, you retried the move operation, and this time it was successful.

4. **Verify MOTD Update:**
   ```bash
   ssh tony@stapp01
   ```
   You logged into the remote server to verify the changes. The updated MOTD is displayed with the Nautilus banner.

It looks like the banner is now successfully applied to the Message of the Day on the `stapp01` server. If you have similar changes to apply to other servers, you can follow a similar process.
