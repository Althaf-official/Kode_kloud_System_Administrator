xFusionCorp Industries has hosted several static websites on Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos DC. There are some confidential directories in the document root that need to be password protected. Since they are using Apache for hosting the websites, the production support team has decided to use .htaccess with basic auth. There is a website that needs to be uploaded to /var/www/html/security on Nautilus App Server 3. However, we need to set up the authentication before that.


1. Create /var/www/html/security direcotry if doesn't exist.

2. Add a user yousuf in htpasswd and set its password to GyQkFRVNr3.

3. There is a file /tmp/index.html present on Jump Server. Copy the same to the directory you created, please make sure default document root should remain /var/www/html. Also website should work on URL http://<app-server-hostname>:8080/security/

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

   To achieve the tasks you mentioned, follow these steps:

### 1. Create the /var/www/html/security directory if it doesn't exist:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/security
```

### 2. Add a user 'yousuf' in htpasswd and set its password to 'GyQkFRVNr3':

```bash
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd yousuf
# You will be prompted to enter the password, and then confirm it.
```

### 3. Copy the /tmp/index.html file to the /var/www/html/security directory:

```bash
sudo cp /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/security/
```

### 4. Configure Apache to enable authentication for the /var/www/html/security directory:

Edit the Apache configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

Add the following configuration at the end of the file:

```apache
<Directory "/var/www/html/security">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Restricted Access"
    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
    Require valid-user
</Directory>
```

Save and exit the text editor.

### 5. Restart Apache to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Now, your website should be accessible at http://<app-server-hostname>:8080/security/ with basic authentication. Users will need to enter the username 'yousuf' and the password 'GyQkFRVNr3' to access the content in the /var/www/html/security directory.
