xFusionCorp Industries uses some monitoring tools to check the status of every service, application, etc running on the systems. Recently, the monitoring system identified that Apache service is not running on some of the Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter.



1. Identify the faulty Nautilus Application Server and fix the issue. Also, make sure Apache service is up and running on all Nautilus Application Servers. Do not try to stop any kind of firewall that is already running.


2. Apache is running on 6000 port on all Nautilus Application Servers and its document root must be /var/www/html on all app servers.


3. Finally you can test from jump host using curl command to access Apache on all app servers and it should be reachable and you should get some static page. E.g. curl http://172.16.238.10:6000/.

   ```

It looks like there are a couple of syntax errors in the Apache configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`. Let's address them:

1. **Extra quotation mark in the `Listen` directive:**
   ```apache
   Listen 6000"
   ```
   It should be:
   ```apache
   Listen 6000
   ```

2. **Extra semicolon in the `DocumentRoot` directive:**
   ```apache
   DocumentRoot /var/www/html;
   ```
   It should be:
   ```apache
   DocumentRoot /var/www/html
   ```

3. **Extra semicolon in the `ServerRoot` directive:**
   ```apache
   ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"
   ```
   It should be:
   ```apache
   ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"
   ```

After making these corrections, save the file and then restart Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Check the status to ensure that Apache is running without issues:

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

These corrections should resolve the syntax errors, and Apache should start successfully. If you encounter any further issues or error messages, please provide the details for further assistance.

The issue is with the syntax of the `Listen` directive on line 26 of the Apache configuration file (`/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`). There is an extra double quote at the end of the line, and it seems like a typographical error. It should be removed.

Replace the following line:

```apache
Listen 6000"
```

with:

```apache
Listen 6000
```

After making this correction, save the file and restart the Apache service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Verify the status of the Apache service to ensure that it is running without errors:

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

If you encounter any further issues or have additional questions, feel free to ask!
