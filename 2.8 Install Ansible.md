During the weekly meeting, the Nautilus DevOps team discussed about the automation and configuration management solutions that they want to implement. While considering several options, the team has decided to go with Ansible for now due to its simple setup and minimal pre-requisites. The team wanted to start testing using Ansible, so they have decided to use jump host as an Ansible controller to test different kind of tasks on rest of the servers.



#### Install ansible version 4.10.0 on Jump host using pip3 only. Make sure Ansible binary is available globally on this system, i.e all users on this system are able to run Ansible commands.

-------------

```ruby
thor@jump_host ~$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

To install Ansible version 4.10.0 on a Jump host using `pip3` and make it available globally for all users, you can follow these steps:

1. **Update `pip3`:**
   Ensure that `pip3` is up-to-date before installing Ansible:

   ```bash
   sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Install Ansible:**
   Install Ansible version 4.10.0 using `pip3`:

   ```bash
   sudo pip3 install ansible==4.10.0
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   Verify that Ansible is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   ansible --version
   ```

   This should display the installed Ansible version.

4. **Ensure Global Accessibility:**
   Check if Ansible is available globally for all users. Typically, the executable should be in a directory listed in the system's `PATH`.

   ```bash
   which ansible
   ```

   If the command returns a valid path (not empty), then Ansible is globally accessible.

5. **Optional: Update System PATH:**
   If the `which ansible` command did not return a path, you may need to update the system's `PATH` to include the directory where Ansible is installed.

   Add the following line to the appropriate profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/ansible/bin/directory
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/ansible/bin/directory` with the actual path where Ansible is installed.

   Then, either restart the shell session or run the following command to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile, etc.
   ```

Now, Ansible should be installed globally on the Jump host, and all users should be able to run Ansible commands.
