The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:



1. Install and configure nginx on App Server 2.


2. On App Server 2 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.


3. Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.


4. For final testing try to access the App Server 2 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/

 ---------

To achieve the requirements provided, you can follow these steps on App Server 2:

### Step 1: Install and Configure Nginx

```bash
# Install Nginx
sudo yum install -y nginx

# Start and enable Nginx service
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

### Step 2: Move SSL Certificate and Key

```bash

# Create the ssl directory
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/

# Move SSL certificate and key to the appropriate location
sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/nginx/ssl/
sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/nginx/ssl/
```

### Step 3: Configure Nginx for SSL

Edit the Nginx configuration file to include SSL settings:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Add or modify the following lines in the `server` block:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name _;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.key;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html;
    }
}
```

Save the changes and exit the text editor.

### Step 4: Create index.html

```bash
# Create index.html file
echo "Welcome!" | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```
The command `echo "Welcome!" | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html` performs the following actions:

1. `echo "Welcome!"`: This command prints the string "Welcome!" to the standard output (usually the terminal).

2. `|`: This is a pipe operator. It takes the standard output of the command on the left side and uses it as the input for the command on the right side.

3. `sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`: The `tee` command reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files. In this case:
   - `sudo`: Runs the command with elevated privileges (as superuser).
   - `tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`: Writes the input it receives to the specified file (`/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`). The `tee` command is used with `sudo` here because writing to `/usr/share/nginx/html/` typically requires elevated permissions.

In summary, this command creates a new file (`index.html`) in the `/usr/share/nginx/html/` directory and writes the text "Welcome!" into it. This file will be served by Nginx as the default content when accessing the root of the web server.

### Step 5: Test Nginx Configuration

```bash
# Test Nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Restart Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 6: Access the App Server 2 from Jump Host

Replace `<app-server-ip>` with the actual IP address or hostname of App Server 2.

```bash
# Test access using curl from the Jump Host
curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/
```

Ensure that there are no errors, and you should see a response from Nginx.

Now, App Server 2 is configured with Nginx, SSL, and the index.html file. You can access it using the curl command from the Jump Host.
