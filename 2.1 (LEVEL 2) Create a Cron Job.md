The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:



### a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.


### b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the `cronie` package on all Nautilus app servers and start the `crond` service, you would typically use a package manager like `yum` (for CentOS/RedHat) or `apt` (for Debian/Ubuntu). Here's a general outline of the steps:

1. Log in to each Nautilus app server with the appropriate administrative privileges.
2. Update the package manager's package list to ensure you have the latest package information.
3. Install the `cronie` package.
4. Start the `crond` service.
5. Add a cron job for the root user to run the specified command every 5 minutes.

Here are the commands you can use for this task:

For CentOS/RedHat (using `yum`):

```bash
# Update package list
sudo yum update

# Install the cronie package
sudo yum install cronie

# Start the crond service
sudo systemctl start crond

# Enable the crond service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable crond

# Add a cron job for the root user
sudo crontab -e
```

In the crontab file, add the following line to run the command every 5 minutes:

```
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
```

Save and exit the crontab file.

For Debian/Ubuntu (using `apt`):

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install the cronie package
sudo apt install cron

# Start the cron service
sudo service cron start

# Add a cron job for the root user
sudo crontab -e
```

In the crontab file, add the following line to run the command every 5 minutes:

```
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
```

Save and exit the crontab file.

Please make sure to replace `sudo` with the appropriate administrative command if you're using a different method for privilege escalation, and adapt the package manager commands based on your server's Linux distribution.
